# sl-gzdoom-wad-picker
A small frontend for picking IWADs and PWADs for GZDoom

### build
It was made using IntelliJ Idea (Community Edition), so I would recommend opening it using that. However, there are other methods of building Java projects and it shouldn't be that hard since you only need the contents of the src folder

When running it from the command line you can pass the path to your Doom WAD directory as an argument, otherwise the file browser will open in your home directory.

Tested on Arch Linux with Java 17 and 21.
